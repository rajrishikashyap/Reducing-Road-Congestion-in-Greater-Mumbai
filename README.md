Project Overview
The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is grappling with severe road congestion problems. This project aims to analyze the current state of road congestion and provide actionable recommendations for both short-term and long-term strategies to improve traffic flow and urban mobility.

Data Preparation
The dataset (traffic.csv) includes traffic data collected from various junctions in Mumbai. The preparation steps involve:

Loading the dataset
Converting the DateTime column to datetime format
Extracting additional features like Hour and DayOfWeek
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing traffic volume over time, by hour of the day, and by the day of the week using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Forecasting Traffic Volume
Time series analysis is performed using the ARIMA model to forecast future traffic volume at specific junctions.

Short-Term Measures
Traffic Signal Optimization
Optimize traffic signals based on real-time data to reduce waiting times and improve flow at congested junctions.

Enforcement of Traffic Rules
Strengthen the enforcement of traffic rules, especially during peak hours, to ensure smooth traffic movement.

Promotion of Carpooling
Encourage carpooling through awareness campaigns and dedicated carpool lanes.

Improvement of Public Transport
Enhance the frequency and reliability of public transport services to reduce dependency on private vehicles.

Long-Term Strategies
Dynamic Congestion Pricing
Implement dynamic congestion pricing to discourage the use of private vehicles during peak hours and in highly congested areas.

Infrastructure Development
Invest in the development and maintenance of road infrastructure, including the expansion of key roads and construction of flyovers.

Development of New Modes of Transport
Explore and invest in new modes of transport such as metro rail, monorail, and dedicated bus lanes to provide efficient alternatives to road transport.

Smart Traffic Management Systems
Implement smart traffic management systems using IoT and AI to monitor and manage traffic in real-time.

Risks and Mitigation Measures
Public Resistance to Change
Conduct extensive awareness and consultation campaigns to explain the benefits of proposed changes and ensure public buy-in.

Implementation and Maintenance Costs
Secure adequate funding and develop a phased implementation plan to manage costs effectively.

Equitable Access to Transportation
Ensure that the proposed changes do not disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and provide alternative solutions where necessary.
